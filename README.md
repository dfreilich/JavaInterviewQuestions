# Java Interview Questions

This repo contains a number of Java problems I wrote for interviews at 3 Israeli companies.  

The questions were:
1. Implement a LRU Cache (2 methods)
1. Create aspects of a Minesweeper Game (not a full implementation)
1. Implement NiceTree, a balanced Binary tree
1. Implement a multithreaded MessageParser
1. Implement parts of a RideMatcher protocol, polling different systems.
